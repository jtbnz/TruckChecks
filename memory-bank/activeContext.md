# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The system has recently undergone significant enhancements to improve user experience and functionality, particularly in the maintenance and filtering capabilities.

## Recent Major Changes

### 1. Authentication System Fixes (Latest Session)
- **Issue**: Logout functionality was broken due to incorrect cookie handling
- **Solution**: Fixed cookie deletion logic in logout.php
- **Impact**: Users can now properly log out and security is maintained

### 2. Edit Functionality Restoration
- **Issue**: Edit capabilities were accidentally removed from maintenance pages
- **Solution**: Restored full CRUD operations to:
  - `maintain_trucks.php`: Add, edit, delete trucks
  - `maintain_lockers.php`: Add, edit, delete lockers with truck assignment
  - `maintain_locker_items.php`: Add, edit, delete items with locker assignment
- **Impact**: Full administrative control restored

### 3. Advanced Filtering System Implementation
- **Feature**: Real-time truck/locker filtering in `maintain_locker_items.php`
- **Capabilities**:
  - Dynamic locker dropdown based on truck selection
  - Instant item list filtering without page reloads
  - Real-time summary updates
  - URL state management for bookmarking filtered views
- **Technical**: AJAX-based filtering with proper JSON endpoints

### 4. Enhanced Add Item Workflow
- **Feature**: Two-step truck/locker selection for adding new items
- **Benefits**:
  - Prevents assignment errors
  - Faster locker selection
  - Intuitive user workflow
- **Implementation**: Separate AJAX handling for add form vs. filter form

### 5. Database Auditing Preparation
- **Context**: User requested audit functionality for tables: items, lockers, trucks, checks
- **Requirement**: Triggers to record deleted data in audit_log table
- **Status**: Ready for implementation in setup.sql

## Current System State

### Working Features
- ✅ User authentication and logout
- ✅ Full CRUD operations on all entities
- ✅ Real-time filtering and search
- ✅ Dynamic form interactions
- ✅ Report generation
- ✅ QR code functionality
- ✅ Email integration

### Recent Technical Improvements
- **AJAX Architecture**: Proper JSON endpoints with error handling
- **JavaScript Enhancement**: Real-time DOM updates without page reloads
- **URL Management**: Browser history integration for filtered states
- **Form Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and user feedback

## Next Steps & Pending Work

### 1. Audit System Implementation
- **Task**: Add audit triggers to setup.sql for tables: items, lockers, trucks, checks
- **Requirements**:
  - Create audit_log table structure
  - Implement DELETE triggers for each table
  - Store complete row data before deletion
  - Include timestamp and user context

### 2. Potential Enhancements
- **Mobile Optimization**: Further touch interface improvements
- **Bulk Operations**: Multi-select and bulk actions
- **Advanced Search**: Full-text search capabilities
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Usage statistics and trends
- **API Development**: RESTful endpoints for external integration

## Key Technical Decisions

### AJAX Implementation Pattern
```javascript
// Established pattern for AJAX requests
function updateData() {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open('GET', window.location.pathname + '?ajax=endpoint&param=value', true);
    xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
        if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
            const data = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
            // Update DOM
        }
    };
    xhr.send();
}
```

### PHP AJAX Handler Pattern
```php
// Handle AJAX requests FIRST, before any HTML output
if (isset($_GET['ajax'])) {
    header('Content-Type: application/json');
    // Process request
    echo json_encode($response);
    exit;
}
```

## User Feedback Integration
- **Filtering Request**: User wanted truck/locker filtering - implemented with real-time updates
- **Add Item Enhancement**: User wanted guided truck/locker selection - implemented with dynamic dropdowns
- **Audit Request**: User wants deletion tracking - ready for implementation

## Development Workflow
1. **Authentication First**: Always ensure proper login checks
2. **AJAX Before HTML**: Handle AJAX requests before any output
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and user feedback
4. **Mobile Consideration**: Touch-friendly interfaces
5. **Performance**: Minimize database queries and page reloads

## Code Quality Standards
- **Prepared Statements**: All database queries use PDO prepared statements
- **HTML Escaping**: All user output properly escaped
- **Consistent Styling**: Shared CSS classes and patterns
- **Documentation**: Clear comments and memory bank maintenance
